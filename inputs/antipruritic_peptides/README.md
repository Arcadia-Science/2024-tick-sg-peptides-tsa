The files in this directory were downloaded directly from the [NCBI protein database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/) on April 3, 2024.
The search criteria used to identify the amino acid sequences in each file is recorded as the file name.
For example, we used "tachykinin-4" used to find all of the sequences in [tachykinin-4.faa](./tachykinin-4.faa). 
However, we used spaces instead of underscores where ever underscores are used in the file name.
The one exception to these two search criteria are sequences in the [ziconotide](./ziconotide.faa) file which we identified by searching "omega conotoxin MVIIA".
